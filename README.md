# Image-Classification

This project implements a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using Neural Network. The model is built with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).







Neural network consists of


1.Input Layer
2.Hidden Layer
3.Output Layer






Training


1.Epochs
2.Batch Size







The main modules and packages used in the digit recognition neural network project:





Required Packages:



1.Tensor Flow
2.Keras
3.Matplotlib
4.Numpy






Preprocessing Technique


1.Normalization
2.Reshaping
3.Splitting Dataset
4.Data Augumentation
5.Early stopping
